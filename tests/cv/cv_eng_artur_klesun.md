### My programming skills
  
<b>PHP</b>: I know every single sad detail of it because I wrote in it for almost three years in my present job.  
My superior frequently asks me tech questions like in what order does built-in function take arguments or does language allows doing this and that in such context or how was function that does this was called, etc...

<b>Javascript</b>: this is my personal favourite language forever. I love the conception of functions being pure variables and absence of Java-like classes. I developed and adapted from colleagues a lot of techniques that are possible only here (if you take me, I promise, I'll show some of them to you). This is the main language of a big open source [music generation app](https://github.com/klesun/shmidusic.lv) developed by me. Most of [my _reputation_](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2750743/artur-klesun) on Stack Overflow is gained by Javascript-related answers.

<b>Java</b>: I used to write a lot in it [in past](https://github.com/klesun/old_java_shmidusic). I believe I know everything I need to write any app.

<b>C#</b>: I am currently developing a [Unity game](https://github.com/klesun/denya-loves-whiskey) in it for half a year already. Likewise, I know all the language-specific stuff.

<b>Python</b>: frequently use it for scripts to process/organize lots of data. Also I host a website using it as a server-side language.

<b>SQL</b>: like the PHP, it is required a lot at my present job, so I can create tables, do selects, alters, updates... simple JOIN is intersection, LEFT JOIN is union. I also know many nice tricks how to generate SQL from PHP array-s using `implode()`-s and `array_map()`-s. Hope I won't need this knowledge at your place, though.

<b>HTML, CSS</b>: I believe I know a lot about this stuff for a backend developer. I don't mind doing any job as long as it is usefull. I can construct intuitive user interfaces and apply basic styling to them. Though, I have little knowledge about `bootstrap`, `angulars.js` and the rest.

From the list above you could conclude that I'm highly experienced in high-level languages from my work and own non-profit projects.  
About working with low-level languages like C/C++ my knowledge is completely academic, though I understand the basic concept of allocating memory and benefits of it.  
As I wrote about my attitude towards writing web design, I'm ok doing anything as long as someone needs it, so if you only have a job to write C/C++ code, I'll gladly accept it and do my best.  


I don't mind any indentation/naming convention and I am absolutely tolerant to any of my superior's decisions that are not related to actual logic:  
like project structure, how to call methods/classes, input/output format conventions... - I'm don't mind whatever you come up about these things.

As a matter of fact, my home pc operating system is <b>Linux</b>. This probably should tell you a lot about what kind of developer I am.

### My other skills

I have quite an amount experience in <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> and <b>Adobe After Effects</b> (a software for video editing) gained from self-study. Not sure how this may be of use to you, but I can do stuff like chroma-keying, motion capture, image animation and some complicated effects, like for example light-sabers in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a6se2DrNF4&feature=youtu.be&t=4m34s).  
Some of my videos:

https://youtu.be/_a6se2DrNF4

I also am familiar with basics of 3D editing/animation using software called [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

And also, this is definitely of no use for you, but I have a very good musical ear training and I can sing really good. I sang in professional church choir in my school years.
