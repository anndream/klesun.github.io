### This is my professional recommendation for Denis Orlov, an IT bachelor, hardware geek, and just a good guy.

I know Denis for many years. He is a trustworthy dedicated person, fast to learn and easy to collaborate with. He is good at speaking in three languages, capable of quickly coming up with a solution in unexpected situations, responsible and effective at whatever he does, slightly impulsive, but resourceful and enthusiastic, that's the kind of person he is.

We participated in several creative projects together. He was not afraid to stay late for the deed, having one or two out-of-the-box ideas in his sleeve to implement. Denis was good at both brainstorming and the actual handwork. Be it the official speeches or the encouragement for the teammates, he knew the right words in every situation. He also knew what to say to help team not to die from boredom when douing routine jobs.

Among other things, this guy is a semiconductor maniak no less than your common PC service specialist. This is whom I ask for help if I need to disassemble a laptop, change a thermal grease, setup a lan, and I know that the job will be done top notch. Messing with BIOS, installing an OS with all the drivers, configuring the stuff is also his forte, he could install an ethernet driver without a usb stick. And he knows so many unix commands that some admins would envy his knowledge.

I would be happy to work with a person like Denis. There is always not enough such people in our company.
