 Work XP-rience
----------------

- 2014-06-01 - present time (4 years)<br/>
Backend Developer at "Internation Travel Network" travel agency.<br/>
Website: https://itncorp.com<br/>
General Distribution System (GDS) integration department.<br/>
 We write PHP code to connect to different distribution systems, like Galileo, 
Sabre, Amadeus, Hertz, Delpaso, usually via SOAP XML protocol and do stuff there. 
A major part of our work is to make life of travel agents easier.
We give them a single terminal GUI that gives them access to all systems we support 
at once. That involves a lot of  airline terminal text parsing, writing SQL-s to 
interact with database, implementing various logics that our travel business guys 
request... Most of that we always cover with PHPUnit tests. My job also involves 
developing frontend stuff sometimes.<br/>
 For version control we use git. In years of co-operation we learned the good 
practices like keeping files small, commiting by little, but frequently, deliver 
basic functionality soon and then extending according to client wishes...<br/>
