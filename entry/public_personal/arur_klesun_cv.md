 Work Experience
----------------

- 2014 - present time (5 years)<br/><br/>
    Backend Developer at "Internation Travel Network" travel agency.<br/>
    Website: https://itncorp.com<br/>
    [GDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system) integration department.<br/><br/>
     We write PHP code to connect to different distribution systems, like Galileo, 
    Sabre, Amadeus, Hertz, Delpaso, usually via SOAP XML protocol and do stuff there. 
    A major part of our work is to make life of travel agents easier.
    We give them a single terminal GUI that gives them access to all systems we support 
    at once. That involves a lot of  airline terminal text parsing; a ot of work with 
    MySQL databases and Redis; implementing various interesting ideas our travel business guys 
    request... Most of that we always cover with PHPUnit tests. My job also involves 
    developing frontend stuff sometimes.<br/><br/>
     For version control we use git. In years of co-operation we learned the good 
    practices like keeping files small, commiting by little, but frequently, deliver 
    basic functionality soon and then extending it according to client wishes...<br/>
    <br/>
    If you track history of ITN, you could tell that the 2014 was the start a golden age for 
    this company. Before I started developing it, it was just a relatively small travel agency. 
    Now it shows on the first pages in google and have mostly very positive ratings by customers 
    (except for reviews related to Ticket Protection, whcih is one of the few things there that weren't written by me).
