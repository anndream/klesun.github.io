Hi, I'm Artur Klesun, an anything backend developer.
You definitely would like to hire me, since I'm very skillful and experienced programmer.

My main selling points are my big open source projects, some having 20000+ users. You can find them in my CV:
https://github.com/klesun/midiana.lv/blob/master/entry/public_personal/artur_klesun_cv.md
(some of them written in Java, btw)

I'm more of a coding guy, but I can speak with the customers pretty well when needed too.

I'm cool with the Java, C# and JS, wrote tens of thousands lines of code in each of them. 
I'm actually language-agnostic, can write in any existing language, no matter, is it functional, statically-typed, with manual memory allocation, etc...
I'm good at understanding complex systems and explaining how stuff works to others.
Able to come up with smart recursive algorithms and implementing them (see my projects).
5 years of coding experience.

Hi. I'm a full-stack developer (more towards backend, though).
I'm talented and experienced. I'm also dependable and harworking -  you will quickly see that I'm worth my pay.

I once was on a presentation led by your lead, he seemed like a cool dude, so I'm applying here. I also love javascript with all my soul, so I guess we'll be on the same wave.
