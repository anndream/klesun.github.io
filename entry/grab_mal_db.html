    <h3>Script to fetch all users anime lists from <a>myanimelist.com</a></h3>
    <p>
        You see, MAL has a shitty way of determining average score.
        There are people (or children) that put 10-s to everything.
        To deal with each person's individual score system, one must use not
        his absolute anime score, but the difference between this score and
        the average of all this person's scores.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have few more idea-s and desire to research the stuff.
        For all these purposes i need the data from MAL.
        That's what this script is for.
